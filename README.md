# Bank Marketing Prediction

For the third practical application dataset, we will be comparing the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) using the marketing of banking products dataset located <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing">here</a>.The data is from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns.
## Business Problem 
Developing a predictive model using real-world data from a Portuguese marketing campaign for bank deposit subscriptions to increase campaign efficiency by identifying key factors that influence success and optimize resource allocation and target customer selection.The goal was to increase efficiency of directed campaigns for long-term deposit subscriptions by reducing the number of contacts to do.In particular, the goal is to predict, by using binary classification, whether or not the customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit.

CRISP-DM - This is the project management method used in the process to determine the findings.The below diagram explains the overall crisp-dm process.
